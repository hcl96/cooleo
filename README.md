Cooling for Rocket Engines Optimized (CooLEO)
===========
This repo includes the latest version of CooleO (June 16, 2018)
CooleO optimizes the cooling system of a rocket engine given the engine geometry, thermal and propellant constraints.
Code applied in design of Ignus II rocket engine.
Increased fuel efficiency by 7% (20% -> 13%) from Ignus I to II.
Validated by hot-fire test of engine on June 16th, 2018.

For sample data, use rpdata.mat. This includes the engine thermodynamic properties generated from RPA.exe.

For sample result, see cooleo_result.png. Shown in black, blue and red are engine contour, heat transfer, and coolant temperature (K) respectively.
